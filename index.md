# Jayanth Yetukuri
I am a fifth year Phd student in the CS department of UC, Santa Cruz. I am working with [Prof. Yang Liu](http://yliuu.com/) on user centric _Actionable Recourse_. My research interests are in societal aspects of _Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning_, including but not limited to _robustness_, _recoursability_, _fairness_ and is centered explicitly around improving _trustworthiness_ of the models.
