# Jayanth Yetukuri
I am a third year Phd student in the CS department of UC, Santa Cruz. I am working with [Prof. Yang Liu](http://yliuu.com/) on enhancing the performance of machine learning models in the noisy setting. My research interests also include understanding robustness in neural networks and robust algorithms in general.

# Past Projects:
### Estimating Ambient Population of any Arbitrary Geographical region
Built a model to estimate time-sensitive ambient population of any ad-hoc region based on human mobility data. Worked on classical census data and contemporary mobile data to build a reliable model.

# Ongoing Projects
### Loss correction technique for Noisy labels using Nearest Neighbour
Exploiting the neighbourhood region of an instance during the training process as a loss correcting mechanism for
obtaining robust models for data with only noisy labels.

### Being Lazy is Robust: Defending against Pseudo Oracle Attack for Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits
This study aims to investigate robust algorithms for stochastic multi-armed bandit problems with adversarially corrupted
rewards. Performance was studied against corruptions from a pseudo-oracle attack.
