I am a third year Phd student in the CS department of UC, Santa Cruz. I am working with [Prof. Yang Liu](http://yliuu.com/) on enhancing the performance of machine learning models in the noisy setting. My research interests also include understanding robustness in neural networks and robust algorithms in general.
